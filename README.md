The "Evergreen" StrategyI implemented the evergreen logic using localStorage to maintain a "sticky" session for each unique visitor12. This ensures the urgency feels authentic—if a user leaves and returns 10 minutes later, the clock hasn't reset; it’s exactly where they left it13.+12. Multi-Tenant Data IsolationTo ensure scalability and security, the MongoDB schema indexes every document by the shop domain14. This isolates merchant data and keeps API lookups efficient even as the database grows15.+13. Performance FirstThe storefront widget is optimized to be under 30KB gzipped, satisfying the PRD performance requirements16. I also implemented Cache-Control headers on the App Proxy to ensure the timer data is delivered from Shopify's edge servers in under 200ms17171717.+2📈 Future RoadmapConversion Tracking: Beyond impressions, tracking "Add to Cart" and "Checkout" events triggered by timers18.A/B Testing: Allowing AI to generate two different copy variations to see which converts better19.Smart Scheduling: AI-driven suggestions for sale durations based on store traffic patterns20.
